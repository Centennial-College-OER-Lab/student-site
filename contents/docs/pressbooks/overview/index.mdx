Pressbooks-Tailwind is a CSS utility framework **inspired by** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), **specifically designed and adapted** for use within Pressbooks. It's being developed and maintained by the [Centennial College](https://centennialcollege.ca) OER Lab to provide a consistent, efficient, and maintainable styling system for our Pressbooks projects.

## Project Overview

**Pressbooks Tailwind** is made possible because of Pressbooks' CSS preprocessor, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), which adds programming language like features. Pressbooks uses [scssphp](https://github.com/scssphp/scssphp) as it's underlying Sass compiler (different from node-sass).

Key features of Pressbooks-Tailwind include:

- **Utility-First Approach:**  Style elements by composing small, single-purpose utility classes directly in your HTML.
- **Consistent Design Language:**  Enforce a unified visual style across all OER Lab Pressbooks projects.
- **Rapid Development:**  Significantly speed up styling workflows by reducing the need to write verbose custom CSS.
- **Improved Maintainability:**  Utility classes are predictable and reusable, making stylesheets easier to understand, update, and maintain over time.
- **Responsive by Default:**  Built-in responsive modifiers allow you to easily adapt designs for different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability across devices.
