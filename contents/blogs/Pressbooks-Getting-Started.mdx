## Book Structure in Pressbooks: Parts and Chapters

A book written in Pressbooks is made up of chapters which are grouped and ordered into parts. chapters are web pages or building blocks within which content is added. Parts are overarching sections that hold chapters (Pressbooks Guide).

Please don't create all the chapters under the Main Body. Instead, create a separate part and then click the "Add Chapter" button next to it to organize your content properly.

![Chapters placed directly under the Main Body should be avoided and marked with a red cross to indicate incorrect structure.](/images/create_chapter_not_recommended.png)

The overall structure of the book should follow this format:

- Part 1
  - Chapter 1.1
  - Chapter 1.2
  - Chapter 1.3
- Part 2
  - Chapter 2.1
  - Chapter 2.2
  - Chapter 2.3

## CSS Styles

When customizing your Pressbooks project, applying custom CSS styles can help you tailor the look and feel of your content for both web and PDF formats. Pressbooks allows you to add your own CSS through the “Appearance” > “Custom Styles” section, where you can target styles specifically for the webbook and PDF (print and digital print). This flexibility means you can make your online version visually engaging while ensuring the print/PDF version remains clean and professional.
