## Why a Consistent Look & Feel Matters

A unified and consistent Look and Feel is essential for creating a cohesive and professional digital product. In Pressbooks project, consistent styling across all chapters and components enhances visual appeal and improves user experience. This guide serves as a comprehensive reference for styled components used in our Pressbooks projects. It helps student developers in the OER Lab to maintain visual harmony across the book by outlining key design principles and reusable styled components.

This article establishes the visual standards for our Pressbooks projects by detailing the color palette, typography rules, component styles, and asset guidelines to ensure consistency and cohesion across all content. Technical pressbook settings such as theme options and plugin configurations are covered in the [Getting Started with Pressbooks: A Guide for Student Developers.](/blog/pressbooks-getting-started-student)

## Our Approach

To ensure a consistent and accessible design across Pressbooks project, this guide is presented in two complmentary parts:

1. **This Blog Post** - This post serves as the rulebook for our design system. It outlines the core principles behind our visual design and sets the standards for typography, color usage, and component styling. You'll find detailed guidance on how to apply these standards, along with the CSS needed to replicate each styled component featured in the Pressbooks Template.
2. **Pressbooks Template** - Acting as a visual companion to this blog post, a template book displays all styled components in a live Pressbooks environment. It provides a clear, practical view of how each element should look and function. It also serves as the source of the custom CSS, making it easy to copy and implement styles into your own projects.

   **\*Note:** Please do not clone the Pressbooks Template directly. Instead, import only the components and CSS you need. Use both the blog post and reference book together as a guide for proper implementation.
