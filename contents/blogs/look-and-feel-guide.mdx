The Look and Feel Guide serves as a comprehensive reference for the reusable CSS components used throughout the Pressbooks project. This guide provides detailed explanations of each component, along with the default CSS classes available in the Malala theme.

The Malala theme is the default theme used in our projects because it offers a wide range of built-in accessibility features.
