This guide will walk you through the registration process so you can start creating, reviewing, and adapting Open Educational Resources (OER) for your courses.

-   **Cost-Effective for Students:** Provide free or low-cost learning materials, reducing the financial burden on students.
-   **Open Licensing:** Empower you to choose how your content is used and shared.
-   **Multiple Export Formats:** Export your work in formats suitable for print, web, and e-readers (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, etc.).

On the Pressbooks dashboard, look for a section labeled "Book Invitations." This is where you'll find invitations to join OER projects. If you don't see any invitations, you may not have been invited to any books yet, or they may have expired.
