## Book Structure in Pressbooks: Parts and Chapters

A book written in **Pressbooks** is made up of chapters which are grouped and ordered into parts. Chapters are web pages or building blocks within which content is added. Parts are overarching sections that hold chapters ([Pressbooks Guide from eCampusOntario](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/pressbooks/)).

![Chapters placed directly under the Main Body should be avoided and marked with a red cross to indicate incorrect structure.](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/create_chapter_dont.png)

If you plan on using Parts to organize your book, don't create all the chapters under the Main Body. Instead, create a separate part and then click the "Add Chapter" button next to it to organize your content properly. The overall structure of the book should follow this format:

!['Add Chapter' and 'Add Part' button are highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/create_part.png)

- Part 1
  - Chapter 1.1
  - Chapter 1.2
  - Chapter 1.3
- Part 2
  - Chapter 2.1
  - Chapter 2.2
  - Chapter 2.3

## Add Users to Your Book

Adding users to your book allows them to access it based on their assigned roles. You can use your book as a space to implement changes without risking the original content. Inviting others can facilitate book reviews and collaborative work. Follow the step-by-step guide below to invite users.

1. Click 'Users' tab on the left menu
   ![Users link and Add Exising User button are highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/add_user_1.png)
2. Click 'Add Existing User' button
   ![Add new user link, role selection, and add existing user button are highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/add_user_2.png)

## CSS Styles

Customizing your Pressbooks project with custom CSS styles allows you to tailor the look and feel of your content for both web and PDF formats separately. You can add your own CSS in the “Appearance” > “Custom Styles” section, targeting styles for each format. This flexibility helps create an engaging online version while keeping the print/PDF version professional. The following steps explain how to apply custom styles for both formats.

### Apply custom-CSS styles for Web

1. Hover your mouse to the 'Apperance' button on left side
2. Click 'custom styles'
   ![custom styles link is highlighted](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/custom_css_1.png)

   ![The “Custom Styles” tab is selected and 'Web' is selected](/pressbooks-getting-started-student/custom_css_2.png)
4. Click 'Save' button!

## Set Up and Enable H5P Content

H5P content adds interactive elements to your Pressbooks projects, turning static text into dynamic learning experiences. With H5P, you can embed quizzes, interactive videos, drag-and-drop activities, and flashcards directly within your chapters. The following steps explain how to create, enable, and insert H5P activities into Pressbooks.

### Create a New H5P Content

You don’t need an eCampus H5P account to create H5P activities in Pressbooks—you can create them directly by selecting ‘Add New’ under the H5P Content menu. However, having an eCampus H5P account makes the process more convenient, by allowing to easily manage your created activities and explore a wide range of H5P content shared by others, complete with appropriate copyright information.

1. Google H5P and go to [eCampusOntario H5P Studio](https://h5pstudio.ecampusontario.ca/)
2. Register your account if you haven't created one
3. Log in to your account
4. Click 'Create' button on top right of the navigation bar
