## Git Tools Recommendations

These tools are currently in use by members of the OER Lab team. They've been battle tested and improve developer productivity.

### Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs)

[LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit): A fast terminal UI for Git.

- Speedy: Perform complex tasks with a keystroke!
- Visual: See branches and diffs clearly.
- Intuitive: Easy to learn keybindings!

### Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)

**GitHub Desktop:** Simple and effective for managing your repositories.

**IDE Integrations:** Use built-in tools in editors like VS Code for seamless Git management.
Choose what fits your style best and boost your productivity!
