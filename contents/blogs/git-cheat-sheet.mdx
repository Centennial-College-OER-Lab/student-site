While this cheat sheet focuses on commonly used Git commands, it is important to begin by clarifying the distinction between Git and GitHub, as the two are often mistakenly used interchangeably.

- **NOTE:** Check the official [Git cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

**Git**  is a distributed version control system. It runs locally on your computer and helps you track changes in your code, manage different versions, and collaborate with others by merging updates. You can use Git without any internet connection, and it's primarily a tool for managing your source code history.

**GitHub**, on the other hand, is a cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories. It allows you to store your Git-managed projects online, making it easy to share your work, collaborate with teammates, and contribute to open-source projects. GitHub also provides extra features such as issue tracking, pull requests, code reviews, and GitHub Actions for automation.

In short:

-   **Git**  is the version control tool.
    
-   **GitHub**  is a platform that hosts your Git repositories and adds collaboration features.
    
You can think of Git as the engine that powers your code history, while GitHub is the garage where you store and manage that engine with others.

### 1. **Installation & Configuration**
Git can be installed from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com), with platform-specific versions for Windows and Mac. After installation, you should configure your identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "[Your Name]"
git config --global user.email "[Your Email]"
git config --global color.ui auto
```
These commands set your username, email, and enable color output for better readability.

### 2. **Starting a Repository**
To create or clone a repository:
```bash
git init        # Initialize a new Git repo
git clone [url] # Clone an existing repo
```

### 3. **Staging & Committing**
These commands help you prepare changes and save snapshots:
```bash
git status                 # View changes
git add [file]             # Stage a file
git reset [file]           # Unstage a file
git diff                   # Show unstaged differences
git diff --staged          # Show staged differences
git commit -m "message"    # Commit staged changes
```

### 4. **Branching & Merging**
Branches allow you to work on features independently:
```bash
git branch                 # List all branches
git branch [name]          # Create new branch
git checkout [name]        # Switch branches
git merge [name]           # Merge branch into current
git log                    # Show commit history
```

### 5. **Inspect & Compare**
To analyze changes or object history:
```bash
git log branchB..branchA   # Show commits in branchA not in branchB
git log --follow [file]    # Show file history through renames
git diff branchB..branchA  # Show code differences
git show [SHA]             # View object details by commit hash
```

### 6. **Remote Repositories**
Work with remote repositories:
```bash
git remote add [alias] [url] # Add a remote
git fetch [alias]            # Download updates
git merge [alias]/[branch]   # Merge remote changes
git push [alias] [branch]    # Upload local changes
git pull                     # Fetch and merge updates
```

### 7. **Tracking Changes**
Handle file renames, deletions, and moves:
```bash
git rm [file]                         # Delete a file
git mv [old-path] [new-path]         # Rename or move a file
git log --stat -M                    # Show moved file history
```

### 8. **Ignoring Files**
Prevent certain files from being tracked:
- Add rules in `.gitignore`
- Use:  
  ```bash
  git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
  ```

### 9. **Rewriting History**
To adjust past commits or reset to a clean state:
```bash
git rebase [branch]           # Replay changes on top of another branch
git reset --hard [commit]     # Reset to a specific commit
```

### 10. **Stashing Changes**
Temporarily store unfinished changes:
```bash
git stash             # Save changes
git stash list        # View stashes
git stash pop         # Apply and remove the latest stash
git stash drop        # Discard the latest stash
```

## Git Tools Recommendations

These tools are currently in use by members of the OER Lab team. They've been battle tested and improve developer productivity.

### Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs)

[LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit): A fast terminal UI for Git.

- Speedy: Perform complex tasks with a keystroke!
- Visual: See branches and diffs clearly.
- Intuitive: Easy to learn keybindings!

### Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)

**GitHub Desktop:** Simple and effective for managing your repositories.

**IDE Integrations:** Use built-in tools in editors like VS Code for seamless Git management.
Choose what fits your style best and boost your productivity!
