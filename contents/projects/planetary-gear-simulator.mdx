## Description

This lesson is published as an Open Education Resource and is designed to explain the principles of planetary gearboxes to automotive students. To facilitate their understanding, the following components were created:

- A lesson slideshow for a simple gearset, created by Ian Campbell in the School of Transportation at Centennial College.
- A Podcast episode, "A Simple Planetary Gear Set... Let's make an OER!", produced by the School of Transportation at Centennial College, discussing both the technical concepts and the process of building the OER.
- A dynamic Sketchfab 3D Render offering a clear visual representation of gear rotations and component assembly, created by the OER Lab at Centennial College.

- An interactive Gear Simulator allowing users to explore different gear configurations and visualize their mechanical interactions, created by the OER Lab at Centennial College.
