## Project Overview

This project involved the creation of an Open Educational Resource (OER) designed to explain the principles of planetary gearboxes. Our team developed digital components to facilitate understanding:

- An interactive Gear Simulator allowing users to explore different gear configurations and visualize their mechanical interactions.
- A dynamic Sketchfab 3D Render offering a clear visual representation of gear rotations and component assembly.
- A Podcast episode, "A Simple Planetary Gear Set... Let's make an OER!", produced in collaboration with the School of Transportation, discussing both the technical concepts and the process of building the OER.
